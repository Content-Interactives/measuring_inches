## 📚 Standards & Subjects

This interactive aligns with the following topics and standards:

- **📂 Subject Area**: Elementary Math (Grade 1–2)  
- **📏 Topic**: Measurement — Understanding how to measure lengths using an inch ruler  
- **📏 Common Core**:  
  - **1.MD.A.1** – Order three objects by length; compare the lengths of two objects indirectly by using a third object.  
  - **1.MD.A.2** – Express the length of an object as a whole number of length units, by laying multiple copies of a shorter object (unit) end to end; understand that the length measurement of an object is the number of same-size units of length that span it with no gaps or overlaps.  
  - **2.MD.A.1** – Measure the length of an object twice, using length units of different lengths for the two measurements; describe how the two measurements relate to the size of the unit chosen.
